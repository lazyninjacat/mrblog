I'm probably going to be posting a lot of code on this blog. For that I'm going to use MDX!

```js
// MDX lets you write JSX in your Markdown! super convenient
<button>test</button>
```

<button>test button :-)</button>

## MDX

MDX lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown, which will be perfect for this blog since I'm going to be documenting my technical learning here. 
MDX works with Gatsby through [gatsby-plugin-mdx](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-mdx/). I'm learning about it in the Gatsby docs: [Getting Started with MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/getting-started/).
